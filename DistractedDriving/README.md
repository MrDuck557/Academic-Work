# Distracted Driving
This is my Distracted Driving project. It trains and tests a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize various types of distracted driving. Originally, this was a science fair project, but then I developed it into a full research paper. The research paper is currently being pre-printed.

The original science fair files are DistractedDriversProjectConvModelPresentation.ipynb, DistractedDrivingDeepLearningAbstract.pdf, DistractedDrivingReport.pdf, and PosterPages.pdf. The full research paper files are DistractedDriversProjectModelComparison.ipynb and SmallButSmart.pdf
