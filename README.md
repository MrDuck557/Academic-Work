# About
This repository contains all of my code for academics.
It contains three projects: my paper about distracted driving, my code for the International Olympiad of Artifical Intelligence 2024, and my Natural Language Processing for Finance project.

I currently have a research paper that is currently waited to be preprinted. I am also listed as a co-author for a peer-reviewed paper that is in the early peer-review stage.

More information about each project inside each folder.
